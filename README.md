Task: Build out the website according to the mockups/assets provided.

## Building Locally

Given the task, I decided it actually made the most sense to make the website with vanilla js and css. There were no dynamic elements to the feature, so using a frontend framework wasn't necessary. If I had more context about long-term development for the app, it would definitely be worth considering if a framework makes sense.

To serve the app, just clone the repo and open the index.html file, as all of the assets are static:

```
git clone https://github.com/evanjo03/minerva-assignment

cd minerva-assignment
```

## Future Improvements

There are definitely a few things that can be improved with this feature. As the application grows, it would make sense to set up build steps that include things like potentially minifying/compressing js, css and other assets.

## Deployment

The application is deployed and available for viewing here:
